How to compile on OSX 10.10:

Get Homebrew: http://brew.sh

Run exactly as it says on the front page:
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Make sure you run the 'brew doctor' as instructed before doing anything else.

Then run:

brew install sdl2 sdl2_net sdl2_image sdl2_gfx sdl2_mixer pcre jansson pkg-config speex speexdsp freetype libsndfile

When it's done, just hit make and it should compile without errors

TO CREATE AN APP BUNDLE:
Call from main ezquake-source directory. e.g. you probably do something like this:

 $ make
 $ sh misc/install/create_osx_bundle.sh

Current directory should have an ezQuake.app folder which is the app.
There will also be an ezquake.zip which basically just zips up the .app
