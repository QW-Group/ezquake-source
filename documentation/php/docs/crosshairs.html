<p>This feature and manual page has been inherited from the <a href="http://www.fuhquake.net/">FuhQuake</a> client 
made by A Nourai aka 'fuh' (#fuhquake on Quakenet irc).</p>


<p>You can customise the look of your crosshair in this client.</p>


<h2>Builtin Crosshairs</h2>
<p>You can use a builtin crosshair using "crosshair x" where x is bewteeen 2 and 
6.  "crosshair 1" will use the + symbol from your charset.</p>


<h2>Custom Crosshair Symbol</h2>
<p>"crosshair 1" uses the plus symbol from your charset.  Like all characters in
your charset, the plus symbol is an 8x8 image in your charset.  If you change
this image, "crosshair 1" will change.</p>

<p>This client gives you the option of changing what "crosshair 1" looks like without
editing your charset.  To do this create a file called "crosshair.txt" in
c:\quake\ezquake\crosshairs\crosshair.txt (change c:\quake to your quake dir).</p>

<p>The format of "crosshair.txt" is</p>

<pre><code>XOOOOOXO
OXXOXXOO
OXOOOXOO
OOOXOOOO
OXOOOXOO
OXXOXXOO
XOOOOOXO
OOOOOOOO</code></pre>

<p>where</p>
<dl>
<dt>X (or x)</dt><dd>draw a pixel and</dd>
<dt>O (or o)</dt><dd>dont draw a pixel.</dd>
</dl>

<p>This works for both software and GL client version.</p>


<h2>Crosshair Colour</h2>
<p>You change the colour of your crosshair with "crosshaircolor x" where x 
is 0..255.</p>


<h2>Crosshair Size</h2>
<p>You can change the size of your crosshair with "crosshairsize x".</p>

<p>In Software client version, valid crosshairsizes are "crosshairsize x" where x is
1, 2, or 3 (1 is normal size, 2 is double size and 3 is triple size).</p>

<p>In GL client version you can use "crosshairsize x" where x is any number between
0.2 and 8.  Even decimals work.  Note however that some values will distort
the crosshair in GL.  This is because of conwidth and width (conheight and
height) being different.  Change crosshairsize slowly (by 0.05 at a time say)
to find a 'sweet spot'.  You get best performance when width (height)
is an integral multiple of conwidth (conheight).</p>

<p>Crosshair size is independent of conwidth and
conheight.  Also if you wish to sue large crosshairs (using crosshairsize 10 etc)
then its best to make a high resolution crosshair PNG image rather than using
the 8x8 inbuilt crosshairs.</p>


<h2>Crosshair Alpha (GL Only)</h2>
<p>In GL client version "crosshairalpha x" where x is 0..1 will determine the level
of transparency of your crosshair.</p>


<h2>Crosshair Images (GL Only)</h2>
<p>In GL client version you can use a PNG/TGA/PCX image as your crosshair.
The image should be placed in c:\quake\ezquake\crosshairs\ 
(except change c:\quake as needed).</p>

<p>To load the crosshair use "crosshairimage image_name" where
'image_name' is the name of the crosshair image you put in the above directory.</p>

<p>Example, if I have c:\quake\ezquake\crosshairs\cross.png I'd use
"crosshairimage cross" to load it.</p>

<p>To unload the crosshair use crosshairimage "" in the console, or make an alias
"alias unload_crosshair crosshairimage $qt$qt" ($qt is the macro for ").</p>

<p>The variables crosshairsize, crosshairalpha and crosshaircolor all work for
crosshair images too (although sometimes you might not want color to work).</p>



<h2>Making Crosshair Images</h2>
<p>This section explains how to make PNG/TGA crosshairs.</p>

<p>Firstly pick a size.  The image should be square and preferabely have width and
height being a power of 2.  64x64 is a good example.</p>

<p>The problem with powers of 2 is that there is no middle pixel.  For example if
you have a 64x64 image with top left pixel coordinates (1,1) and bottom right 
coordinates (64,64), then the middle is at (32.5, 32.5) which isn't
a real coordinate.  (32,32) and (33,33) are the two real coordinates closest to
the middle. The client centres the 64x64 crosshair so that the (32,32) pixel is
centred on screen.  In otherwords (32,32) is treated as the centre.</p>

<p>In general if you have a crosshair image of width = height = 2^n with top left
coordinate (1,1) and top right coordinate (2^n, 2^n) then the centre of the 
crosshair should be positioned over pixel (2^(n-1), 2^(n-1)).</p>
